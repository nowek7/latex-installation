# How to lint LaTeX code

To lint LaTeX code, you can use a tool like *ChkTeX* or *lacheck*. These tools analyze your LaTeX code and check for common errors, such as misspelled commands, undefined references, and unused labels.

## Linux

### Chktex

1. *ChkTeX* is available for most Linux distributions and can be installed using the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install *ChkTeX* by running:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install chktex
    ```

2. Open your LaTeX document in your favorite text editor and save the file.

3. Run ChkTeX on the LaTeX file using the command:
    ```bash
    chktex filename.tex
    ```
    This will analyze the LaTeX code and report any errors or warnings.

4. Review the output from ChkTeX and fix any errors or warnings that it reports.

### lacheck

1. *lacheck* is available for most Linux distributions and can be installed using the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install *lacheck* by running:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install lacheck
    ```

2. Open your LaTeX document in your favorite text editor and save the file.

3. Run lacheck on the LaTeX file using the command:
    ```bash
    lacheck filename.tex
    ```
    This will analyze the LaTeX code and report any errors or warnings.

4. Review the output from lacheck and fix any errors or warnings that it reports.

## Windows

### Chktex

To lint LaTeX code in Windows, you can use the same tools that are available on Linux, such as ChkTeX or lacheck. However, you'll need to install these tools on your Windows system and set up your environment to use them.

Here are the steps to install and use ChkTeX on Windows:

1. Download the latest version of ChkTeX for Windows from the ChkTeX website: **[http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/chktex/chktex-1.7.6-win.zip](http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/chktex/chktex-1.7.6-win.zip)**
2. Extract the ZIP archive to a folder on your Windows system, such as **C:\chktex**.
3. Add the folder containing the ChkTeX executable to your system's PATH environment variable. To do this, right-click on the Windows Start button and select *System*. Then click on *Advanced system settings* and click on the *Environment Variables* button. Under *System variables*, find the *Path* variable and click *Edit*. Add the path to the folder containing the ChkTeX executable (e.g. **C:\chktex\bin**) to the list of paths, separated by semicolons.

4. Open your LaTeX document in your favorite text editor and save the file.

5. Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to the folder containing your LaTeX document using the **`cd`** command.

6. Run ChkTeX on the LaTeX file using the command:
    ```powershell
    chktex filename.tex
    ```

    This will analyze the LaTeX code and report any errors or warnings.

7. Review the output from ChkTeX and fix any errors or warnings that it reports.

You can follow similar steps to install and use lacheck on Windows. Note that these tools may have different options or customization settings on Windows compared to Linux, so be sure to read the documentation for more information on how to use them effectively on Windows.

### lacheck

Here are the steps to install Lacheck on Windows using the Cygwin distribution:

1. Download and run the Cygwin installer from the official website: **[https://www.cygwin.com/install.html](https://www.cygwin.com/install.html)**

1. In the installer, select *Install from Internet* and choose a download site.
2. On the "Select Packages" screen, search for "lacheck" in the search bar.
3. Click on the "Skip" button next to the *lacheck* package to mark it for installation.
4. Continue with the installation process, making sure to select any other packages you need.
5. Once the installation is complete, you can run Lacheck from the Cygwin terminal by typing *lacheck* followed by the path to your TeX file.

Note that Lacheck is also available as part of the MiKTeX distribution, which is a complete TeX system for Windows. You can download MiKTeX from the official website: **[https://miktex.org/download](https://miktex.org/download)**
